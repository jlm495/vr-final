# Final Project Proposal: XR Arcade
*Dragon rider shoot game*

*Jenna Mandel*

## Project Description

I'm thinking the player is riding a dragon that they can't control, being attacked by other dragons flying at them. The player's objective is to shoot as many other dragons as possible in a certain amount of time, gaining points for each one. I think it would be cool to add the option to jump onto the back of another dragon, but for a 3-5 minute game, that might not be necessary. There will be different dragon types to add variety. Maybe I'll let the player choose their dragon in the beginning?

## Feature Breakdown

1. **Dragon Riding**: The player is basically anchored to a moving object, the dragon
    1. **Estimated Challenge - 2**: I'm hoping this isn't too bad, but I don't know exactly what to expect. I've done a little bit of research, and it seems relatively simple.
2. **Enemy Dragons**: Enemy dragons fly at the player. If they get too close, the game ends. There should be 3-4 different dragon types.
    1. **Estimated Challenge - 3**: This is pretty well within my reach as it relates to the enemy AI & proximity portion. The part I'm nervous about because I've never implemented it is the animations, which I might have to leave it out if it's too difficult. I'm also nervous about the attacks, I think it would be cool to have them shoot fire, but that may be hard.
3. **Player Shoot**: The player shoots at the other dragons with a bow and arrow, or potentially just a regular gun.
    1. **Estimated Challenge - 4**: I think the bow mechanism could be really difficult to implement. I would want it to feel somewhat realistic - the player pulls the string back and fires. I have no idea how to do that, but I'm hoping there are videos online that can help me.
4. **Dragon Teleportation**: The player is able to teleport onto the back of one other dragon.
    1. **Estimated Challenge - 2**: If I'm able to figure out how to fix the player to the first dragon, the teleportation shouldn't be too crazy to implement.

## Milestones

1. **By 11/19** - Implement the player being fixed to the dragon as it moves around the scene, enemy dragons, and time limit
2. **By 12/5** - Implement the shooting mechanism, score system, polish, and (time permitting) teleportation
